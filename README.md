# Smart Contract Procedure

## Purpose
This repository documents a full-stack, step-by-step professional workflow for smart contract deployment, validation, and secure fund operation across blockchain, banking, and compliance protocols.

## Key Features
- Step-based operation from raw file extraction to on-chain validation
- Python, Solidity, and Shell script examples
- Security best practices (AES encryption, certificate chain verification)
- Compliance checklists (SWIFT, IBAN, ERC-20, Alchemy, etc.)
- Transaction logging & archiving for audits

## Structure
- `/docs` – All procedural steps & explanations
- `/scripts` – Python/Shell automation codes
- `/contracts` – Solidity (ERC-20/721) contracts and templates
- `/configs` – Config files for endpoints, wallets, API integration
- `/certs` – Example certificates & public keys for testing

## How to Use
1. Follow each `/docs/stepXX.md` file in order.
2. Use relevant code from `/scripts` or `/contracts` as described.
3. Complete the checklist before submitting for audit or mainnet deploy.

> **Note:** All scripts and contracts are provided as professional documents and require customization for production use.
