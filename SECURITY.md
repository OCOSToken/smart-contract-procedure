# SECURITY POLICY

## Introduction

The security of our smart contract deployment, validation, and fund management procedures is our top priority. This repository adheres to industry best practices and international standards for blockchain security, data protection, and operational compliance.

---

## 1. **Responsible Disclosure**

- If you discover a vulnerability or security issue, **do not create a public issue.**
- Please report security concerns privately by emailing: `security@ocos.io`  
  (or use your project's official email).
- We aim to respond to all reports within **48 hours**.

---

## 2. **Smart Contract Security Standards**

- All smart contracts undergo multi-layer code review.
- Follows **OpenZeppelin**, **CertiK**, and Ethereum Foundation guidelines.
- Only audited, verified contracts are deployed to mainnet.
- Critical actions (mint, burn, upgrade) are restricted to multi-signature wallets.

---

## 3. **Key Management & Access Control**

- All private keys are stored in encrypted hardware modules (HSM).
- Access to production wallets is limited to core team members using multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- No private keys are stored in this repository or any public channel.
- Role-based access controls are enforced for contract interaction and fund movement.

---

## 4. **Data Encryption**

- All sensitive data (certificates, JSON, IBANs, transaction logs) are encrypted at rest and in transit.
- AES-256 and RSA-4096 are used for file-level and communication-level encryption.
- Regular key rotation is implemented for all cryptographic materials.

---

## 5. **Compliance & Auditing**

- All procedures follow **FATF**, **GDPR**, and local data protection laws.
- SWIFT, IBAN, and blockchain validation steps are regularly audited.
- Transaction logs and fund movements are archived for audit and legal traceability.
- Independent third-party audits are conducted annually.

---

## 6. **Incident Response**

- In the event of a security incident:
    - Immediate mitigation steps are executed.
    - All affected stakeholders are notified within 24 hours.
    - A post-incident report is published after the investigation.

---

## 7. **Dependencies and Updates**

- All dependencies are monitored for vulnerabilities via Dependabot/GitHub Security.
- Outdated or insecure packages are updated within 7 days of discovery.
- Automated tests are run on every pull request to prevent regression vulnerabilities.

---

## 8. **User Guidelines**

- Never share your private keys or mnemonics.
- Always validate addresses and transaction data before sending.
- Use only audited dApps, scripts, and smart contracts.
- For large transfers, use multi-signature wallets and enable transaction whitelists.
